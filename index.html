		<h3>Richard's Bio</h3>

		</div>		
			<p>I grew up in Memphis, TN where I attended high school at <a href="www.cbhs.org">CBHS</a>. After a long decision process, I decided to move to Knoxvile where I would evenutally graduate from the University of Tennessee-Knoxville in December of 2013. I love the outdoors, spending time with my friends, playing guitar, wathcing sports, and doing many other things with friends and family. I now live in Nashville where the majority of my friends are as well, but can still travel home to Memphis to see my family in just 3 short hours. I am currently a student at the Nashville Software school where I hope to become a great, young web developer. Before this, I worked in inside sales for 2 years. I quickly found out that that career path was not going to be for me, so I am happy to be a part of NSS!</p>

		<h3>My Interests</h3>
		<p>Being an avid college and professional football fan, I am always keeping up with up-to-date news for my favorite teams. I have found all of that information and more one a site called <a href="http://bleacherreport.com">Bleacher Report</a>. Since I graduated from UT-Knoxville, I cheer on the <a href="http://bleacherreport.com/tennessee-volunteers-football">Vols</a> every Saturday. My parents are both from Philadelphia so I have grown up an <a href="http://bleacherreport.com/philadelphia-eagles">Eagles</a> fan and tune into their games every Sunday.</p>
		
		<p>I am a huge fan of fantasy football, even though it can make or break my Sunday's. I keep up with stats, which players to play, and any other news surrounding the fantasy football world at <a href="http://www.nfl.com/fantasyfootball">NFL.com</a>.</p>
		
		<p>I like to stay aware of current events and what is going on in the world today via <a href="https://twitter.com/?lang=en">Twitter</a> and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/">Reddit</a>.</p>
		
		<p>A cool website called <a href="http://futurism.com/">Futurism</a> provides news stories on the most interesting topics in space, advancements in technology, and the science world in general.</p>
